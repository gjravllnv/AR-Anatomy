# Augmented Reality for Teaching Anatomy Education

The **ARnatomy** is a transformative educational technology with a significant potential to enhance anatomy education for young learners. This study investigates the application of AR in teaching the anatomy of the human body and the reproductive system to Grade 5 students.

The app incorporates ```Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy``` learning methodology, offering six learning stages: ```Remembering```, ```Understanding```, ```Applying```, ```Analyzing```, ```Evaluating```, and ```Creating```. Each stage contains **lectures** and **quizzes** to assess user progress.

## Built Using
- ```AR Core```
- ```Autodesk Maya v2020.4.0.1627```
- ```Unity v2022.3.21f1```
- ```Vuforia v10.29.6```
  
### Key Features
- **Augmented Reality (Markerless based)**: View 3D anatomical models with interactive elements.
- **Quizzes**: Includes **pre-test and post-test** assessments.
- **Progress Tracking**: Unlock stages progressively based on quiz performance.
- **Educational Content**: Covers **Female Reproductive System, Male Reproductive System, and Human Organs**.
- **Feedback System**: AI-powered analysis to guide users in improving their scores.
